    <p>For Senior Design Project, my team of five proposed our own project, developing a High Voltage Motor Controller. The project's goal was to develop a viable platform for controlling the in-hub electric motors used in collegiate competition solar cars, most notably the Mitsuba M2096-III. I joined this team as the simulation and application expert, having worked with these motors for several years as a critical member of Iwa State University's PRISUM Solar Car Team.</p>
    
    <p>Existing controllers for this motor consist of the OEM Mitsuba 2095C and the Prohelion (formally Tritium) Wavesculpter 22. Both of these controllers are incredibly expensive and notorious for having catastrophic failures happen at the worst of times. Our goal was to develop a platform for developing 
        
    replacement for the existing solutions that are expensive and closed systems that are difficult to debug and repair. These motor controller combinations are used for competition collegiate Solar Cars in the low KW power range. As of writing, we are currently working on developing the first hardware and software prototypes.</p>
    
    <p>For this project I am a hardware engineer and the team's topic expert, being the most knowledgeable on the systems and applications this project is intended to meet. While I had experience working with brushless motors and controllers before this project, I have learned a lot about the theory behind brushless motor control and how to design and build electrical hardware that is capable of transmitting and controlling an incredibly useful, but dangerous, amount of power.
